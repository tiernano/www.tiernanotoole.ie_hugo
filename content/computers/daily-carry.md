A couple of years back, I did a post about my [Daily Carry for college](http://tiernanotoole.ie/2013/01/27/college_bag_contents.html)... Well, I have finished (ish) college, but i still cary a lot of weird and wonderful stuff... So, this is the update...

So, the contents are as follows:

{{< cloudinary src="/v1530624866/16317125424_a03f9ec346_m.jpg">}}

* Microsoft [SurfaceBook](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/devices/surface-book) with an i7 processor, 16GB RAM and 512GB Storage, along with the dGPU.
* [Samsung Galaxy Note 3](http://www.samsung.com/uk/discover/mobile/samsung-galaxy-note-3-and-galaxy-gear-the-perfect-match/)
* [Beats by Dr. Dre Wireless on ear headphones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008EQ1YWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B008EQ1YWA&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=7ZYQH6ZH25FE3CBQ). Bluetooth and wired.
* [TP-Link TL-WR703N](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00UMJ3HDQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00UMJ3HDQ&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=7BMHED4CKFRG5MRB) modified with extra RAM and ROM. I will explain this later...
* [TP-Link MR3040](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0088PPFP4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0088PPFP4&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=GYC4WLBAWOUFXLDX) currently used with the modem (see below) but to be replaced with the WR703N eventually...
* [Huawei E3272 LTE Modem](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HT2HP6E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00HT2HP6E&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=KFGQNRYDGTIMJPHO) for broadband. Connected into either of the routers (above) or directly to the laptop.
* [Anker 3 Port USB 3.0 HUB with 10/100/1000mb Ethernet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00KGVP71U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00KGVP71U&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=GD4EI7NYMYZA2ZBK) Probably the coolest thing i have ever found! a 3 port USB 3 hub with a Gigabit Ethernet port included! There is one that came with the M3800, but its USB2 only (so, not fully gigabit) and takes up a USB port and gives nothing back...
* [Anker 3nd Gen Astro E4 13000mAh 2 Port External Battery](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BQ5KHJW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00BQ5KHJW&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=QR7UYYKG6SIQS6GC). Handy little charger, since most of my devices run off USB. And it gives out a fair whack of power too!
* [Linx 8 Inch Windows 8.1 Tablet](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00O636WGI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00O636WGI&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=SFIGWBHIXISO6B53) with Intel Quad core Atom (Z3735G) 1Gb RAM, 32Gb storage, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a 32Gb MicroSD card. Great little device, and handy when the M3800 is too big to use...
* [Microsoft Wedge Keyboard](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B008TM581M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B008TM581M&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=PGRKADHBDM62ADWR) and [Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000TSIAQO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000TSIAQO&linkCode=as2&tag=tiescomclo-21&linkId=R22PEM7OOE5DY3XI) both connected to the Linx Tablet to have a full setup when required.
* [Apple iPhone 6 Plus](http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone6) (Not pictured). This was used to take this photo.
