 I have been running [CrashPlan][1] for a while now, and, other than some minor issues (backup speed to their central location is the big one), everything has been going grand. I use it to backup about 600GB of photos and videos, 500GB+ of VMs, documents, source code and a fair whack of other stuff... In total, about 2TB of data.

Anyway, here are some tips i have figured out over the last while for making Crashplan work a little better...

* [Speeding up your backup][4]
* [Installing CrashPlan on a headless (no monitor or GUI) Ubuntu Server][2]
* [How to get terabytes of data into the cloud using Crashplan Seed Drive][3]

I am also in the process of doing some further tests with iSCSI drives linked to the Cloud, and other weird and wonderful things... once I have finished, i will upload extra stuff here.
