 I have been very interested in VOIP stuff for the last while now, and finally started looking at implementing it in the house. Here are some links which may be useful. I will do a full post soon.

* [Asterisk 1.8 with chan_mobile on Centos 6][1]: chan_mobile allows you to use a Bluetooth phone to make calls with Asterisk
* [Use an old Mobile Phone as a GMS Gateway in asterisk][2]: again, similar to above, but with Ubuntu.
* [3CX][3]: my current choice in VOIP software.

The main VOIP hardware I use is:

* [Cisco Small Business Pro SPA3102 Voice Gateway with Router (Amazon UK)][4]
* [Cisco Small Business Pro SPA3102 Voice Gateway with Router (Amazon US)][5]

I also use the 3CX software on both my iPhone and Android.

* [3CX phone for Android][6]
* [3CX phone for iPhone][7]
