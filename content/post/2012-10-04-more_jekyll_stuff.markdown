Couple of bits and pieces on Jekyll stuff today... I am tweaking the outline of the site, so i am surfing around finding stuff... here is what i have found

* [Host a static site on Amazon S3][1]: Interesting idea, and something i would look into eventually... And with the help of [CloudFront][2] you could host your whole blog on a CDN!
* [Rake tasks for Jekyll][3]: Rake is the Ruby version of make... and a RakeFile can have tasks, which are in Ruby... They can do, from what i can gather, pretty much anything... So, some examples of what you can do with them are linked here... I especially like the New Post generator... very handy!
* [Jekyll Plugins][4]: Various different plugins for Jekyll... I am interested in a few of these, mainly the Generate_projects one, which generates a page for your projects based on your [GitHub][5] projects... very cool stuff...
* Strictly speaking, this is not just a Jekyll how to, but [Migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll][5] is a handy read. my [main blog][6], [my podcast][8] and [photography blog][7] both run WordPress. migrating them to Jekyll would mean i could move them directly to a CDN and make things a lot faster... Maybe something i plan doing soon...

If you have any tips or tricks, why not leave a comment and i can add them to the post.
