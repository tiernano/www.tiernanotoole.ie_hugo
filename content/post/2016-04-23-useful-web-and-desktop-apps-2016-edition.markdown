I have decided to do a post on some of my favourite tools to use for development, administration, etc. Itâ€™s kind of like [Hanselman's Ultimate Tools list][1], but not as popular and about 2 years newer... Anyway, the [list is available here][4], and will be updated over time, much like my [Daily Carry][2] and [Computers][3] pages. If you are interested, you add links though [GitHub][5] by editing the [toolslist.yml data file][6].
