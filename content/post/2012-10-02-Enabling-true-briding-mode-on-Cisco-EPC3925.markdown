title: Enabling True Bridging modem on a Cisco ECP3925 Cable Modem (UPC Ireland)
---

I am a [UPC Ireland][1] customer, and have 2 cable modems into the house, both Cisco EPC3925s. These are not exactly great modems for power users, but are grand for normal use... Me, however, being a poweruser wanted something a little more, how should I put it, powerful. 

A couple of months back, a tutorial was posted on [Boards.ie][4] which showed you [How to enable "bridging" on your UPC modem][3]. When i say "Bridging", they used DMZ, turned off firewalls, static IPs internally, turned off Wifi and DHCP, etc. It worked, quite well actually, but was "odd"... Today, however, there is a new tutorial [Enabling REAL bridging on a Cisco EPC3925][2]. I have tried this, and so far, it works! now just to set my router to work correctly, and update my IPs if they change...
