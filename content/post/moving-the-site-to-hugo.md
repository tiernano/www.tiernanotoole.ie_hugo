After a LOT of messing with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), i have finally moved to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)! There are a few things that don't fully work yet, and there will be updates to the site soon enough, but for the moment, I am happy... Its also a LOT faster to build than Jekyll, and less dependencies... Happy days!
