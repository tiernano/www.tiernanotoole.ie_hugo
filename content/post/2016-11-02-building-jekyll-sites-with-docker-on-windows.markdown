As some of you probably know (or based on the footer of the site) this site is built with [Jekyll][1]. Jekyll is a static web site builder, written in Ruby, and is a bit of a pain to build on Windows. Earlier on this year, I [wrote up a post][2] explaining how to use Jekyll on Windows using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows... It was a bit complicated, and, well, worked a few times, but was not too successfull... So, were do we go next? Well, [Docker][3] to the rescue!

I am running the [Windows 10 Anniversary edtion][4] witch has [container][5] and [docker support][6].  using the [repo for this site][7] and the scripts (specifically [build-tiernanotooleie][8] and [geekphotographer.com][9]) i can build the docker site on my local Windows machine and upload the sites as required (I host on [NFSN][10] and upload via [RSync][11]). The docker image i build from is a Linux docker image, do i need a Linux container running (and the docker tooling). I also use Bash on Ubuntu on Windows to upload using RSync. All is going well so far...
