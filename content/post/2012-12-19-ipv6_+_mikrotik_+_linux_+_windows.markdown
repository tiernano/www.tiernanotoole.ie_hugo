I have been wanting to setup an [IPv6][1] network for a while now, but never had the hardware or network to support it. My broadband Modem, a Cisco EPC3925, was pretty useless... But with the advent of [Bridging on the Cisco EPC3925][2] it now works!

The first thing i needed to do was setup a [Tunnel Broker Account][5] with [Hurricane Electric][6]. I got a /64 block of IPv6 addresses, which should do me for a while... :) 

Next, I followed the config example from the MikroTik Wiki Page: [My First IPv6 Network][4]. In my case, i only ran though most of router 1's config, and did not create the "routing between segments" and "ospv-v3" backbone... I did give my internal LAN port an IPv6 address, as well as an IPv4 address. 

Next, on my Windows Server machine, i gave it a static IPv6 address (since i dont have an IPv6 DHCP setup... yet...) and told it to use the IPv6 address i gave the RouteBoard as its gateway. Then i told it to use the [OpenDNS][7] [public IPv6][8] address. I then visited [IPv6 Test][9] and [Google's IPv6 page][10] to confirm connectivity... SUCCESS!!!

On my Linux box, I followed [Soflayer's Adding an IPv6 IP][11] tutorial. 

So far, so good...
