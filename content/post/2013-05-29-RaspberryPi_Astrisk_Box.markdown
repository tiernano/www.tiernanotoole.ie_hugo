The [Raspberry Pi][2] is a pretty amazing peice of kit for its price and size. And now, you can make it even more amazing by using it as a VoIP server for your house! 

Check out [Raspberry Asterisk][1] for downloads, documentation, etc, on how to setup a Raspberry Pi and [Asterisk][3]. I have a couple Pi's in the house, and plan on setting this up in the next few days. Keep your eyes on the site... more posts coming!

Also, as an added bonus: You can now use a 3G/HSDPA modem to make and recieve calls using Asterisk and your Pi! [Carrier Connect][4] has details of how they setup a couple of Raspberry Pi devices in Germany and Cambodia and anyone ringing from Germany got redirected to Cambodia, with no noticable issue. Very cool stuff! Have to try this!

Double Bonous: Chan-Dongle (the software that you use to make and recieve calls with GSM) also allows the [device to accept SMS messages][5]!
