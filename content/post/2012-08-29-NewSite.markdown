So, this site is brought to you by [GIT][1], [Jekyll][3] and Magic... here is how i did it...

* I have a Linux VM running the site. Its an [Ubuntu 12.04][4] server. On that i installed Jekyll.
* I also have [gitolite][6] installed for personal git repos.
* In the Git Repo for this site, under the hooks directory, I added a post-receive file which I got from [here][2] originally.
* Apache is set to serve the directory that Jekyll produces... That's what you are reading here.
* If you are interested, you can find the code and config for this site on my [github repo][5]
