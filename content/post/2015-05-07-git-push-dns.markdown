 There are now a lot of services that have "git push" options available... you can build websites with
[Azure][1] and [Github][2], books using [ShareLaTeX][3] and now, DNS using [LuaDNS][4]. I have one zone
running at the moment ([tiernanotoole.net][5]) and you can see the DNS records on [github here][6]. I am
tempted at moving other records over soon... but i am currently on [Amazon Route53][7] and 1: its works, so
dont break it, and 2, not sure how to bulk export records from Route53 to Bind or [Lua][8] format.

[update] 2 quick updates: 1) their free account, which is what i am using, allows 3 domains and 30 host
records. they also charge less than [Route53][7]:

* route 53 for 10 domains per year cost 50c per domain (first 25) per month, then query charges. total,
about $60 + queries (@40c per million).
* luadns cost $29 a year for 10 domains, 5 million (ish) querys a month and 500 host records...

I think i have nearly 30 domain on AWS... so, their $59 a year package, which include 30 domains, would
probably save me money...

and 2) i forgot about one of those git push services... [DeveloperMail][9] is a service, for developers,
for managing email servers. IMAP, SMTP, Git... all supported! just signed up... $2 a month per user. Lets
see how this works...
