Quick tip for all you with internet facing [VMWare ESXi][1] Hosts. I
have just got my hands on a box on the [Hetzner][2] network (more on
that later) and using their LARA system i installed ESXi on it. All was good, then I tried login in a couple hours later and i kept getting errors about my password being wrong... So, i tried a few more times,  got pissed off and rebooted the box (had to do a hard reboot, since i couldn't even get in over KVM). I though this was a hardware issue, or a config issue, and left it... yesterday, i had the console open most of the day, and when looking at something i noticed this:

Well, that's why I couldn't login! So, tip: create a second user account, name it something other than root, give it a secure password and use that to login to your ESXi box. Ideally, your ESXi box should be behind a firewall, but in the case of a dedicated server, that may not be financially feasible... Hope this helps someone!
