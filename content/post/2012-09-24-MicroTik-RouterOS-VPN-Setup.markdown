 I have been running a [MikroTik RouterBoard][1] in the house for a couple of months now (the [RB750G][2]) and I am very much loving the thing. But one thing you may need to do is setup VPN connections... Here are some tips on how to create a VPN Server and Client on your RouterBoard.

##Client Setup

to setup a client, you need to do the following:

{{< gist tiernano 8581643 >}}

What does that all do? the first line creates an l2tp-client interface, pointing at "servername" with the username and password set. encryption, etc is enabled... Line 2 then enables the client. Line 3 sets all traffic comming from networkaddress/24 (for example, 192.168.0.1/24) to be sent though the VPN. any traffic going into networkaddress (same example) is not sent though the VPN. Line 4 creates a gateway, for all addresses (0.0.0.0/0) to use the VPN address. finally, NAT Masquerading is enabled on the VPN interface.

there are more advanced things you can set above... some examples I can think of are as follows:

* There should be no good reason to limit the amount of VPN connections you have... in theory, you could have multiple...
* for the mangle rule, set the src-address to a single machine in your network. that way, it gets VPN only connections. Also, you could set the dst-address to a single address or network to send only traffic going to a given server though the VPN... Example would be Netflix US traffic to a US VPN server, BBC iPlayer traffic to a UK VPN, etc.
* the example above uses L2TP, but PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN are also available.

## Server Setup

As mentioned above, L2TP, PPTP, SSTP and OpenVPN servers are available on RouterOs. Details on setting them up are available on MicroTik's Wiki at the following locations:

* [OpenVPN][3]
* [PPTP][4]
* [L2TP][5]
* [SSTP][6]
