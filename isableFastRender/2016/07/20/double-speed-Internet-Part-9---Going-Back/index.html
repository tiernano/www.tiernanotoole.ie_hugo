     <p>[NOTE] This part 9 in a series of posts. The rest can be found <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/tag/Double_Internet/">here</a></p>

<p>Well, the double internet experiment is about ready to be finished&hellip; After 9 posts, 4 months, lots of sweating, many painful nights trying to figure out why something stopped using, shouting when <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> did not work, wondering why my internet connection was so slow, and many, many other problems, i have decided to wind down the project. in the last 9 posts, i have learned a lot, and i hope i have helped someone figure out some stuff on their end. Even though this is a wind up of the project, there are still new things i have to share.</p>

<ul>
<li>I found another project that has potential for speeding up the internet: <a href="http://www.vrayo.com/how-to-set-up-a-bonding-vpn-connection-in-linux/">VTrunkd</a>. after some testing, i does seem to manage to speed up the connection, but either limits on hardware i have in house, or limits of hardware in the cloud, or even the software, stopped me in my tracks&hellip; i did see 400mb/s out of it at one stage, using 200mb/s from each modem&hellip; its close, but its not the full 720&hellip;</li>
<li>messing with <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/">Quagga/Zebra</a> as mentioned in <a href="https://www.tiernanotoole.ie/2016/06/08/double-speed-internet-part-8-routing-around.html">the previous post</a> has been, well, interesting&hellip; I did manage to get all <a href="http://www.ovh.ie">OVH</a> traffic sent though their server, <a href="https://m.do.co/c/d4d345b83b55">Digital Ocean</a> traffic sent over that box, and everything else over <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en">Hetzner</a>. I added an <a href="http://www.azure.com">Azure</a> box to the mix for a while, aswell as a <a href="http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6925433">Vultr</a> box, but it got very messey, very quickly. if i had something automated, it would be better.</li>
<li>the idea of having a /29 IP range in <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en">Hetzner</a> and forwarding it though the tunnels back to the house did work. My <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64">Meraki MX64</a> had one IP address, i had a mail server on a second, everything else on a third, and was planning on using more&hellip; but its just, well, again, messy. So, i will be going back to the idea of 2 IP addresses, and hoping whatever i put infront of the network can figure stuff out&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what am i moving to? well, thats a question&hellip; Currently, i have the <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/products/appliances/mx64">Meraki MX64</a> plugged directly into the modems, and protecting my LAN. So far, so good, but due to hardware limits, it maxes out at around 260mb/s. So, thats out of the question for the main network! I did at one stage have <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en/products/free-tools/sophos-utm-home-edition.aspx">Sophos UTM Home edition</a> running. Sophos also have their <a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-xg-firewall-home-edition.aspx">XG firewall</a> available for home use, so i might try that&hellip; There is also <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">PFSense</a> which i used before also&hellip; And there may be more&hellip; Maybe there will be a new series reviewing these home firewalls? we will see&hellip;</p>
