After a few months of running [Sabayon][1] Linux on the GodboxV2, i am going back to Windows Server. Back around October of last year, i installed Windows 10 Preview on the GodBoxV2, and, well, there where issues with graphics drivers, etc. Then, some time after, i cant remember off hand when, i moved to Sabayon Linux. Its based on [Gentoo][2] but has a lot of the components pre-built. Gentoo is a "Build from scratch" sort of OS. You get a basic kernel and a basic set of components, but you build everything else from scratch... including rebuilding the kernel if you want. Sabayon, on the other hand has all that mostly prebuilt, though you can still use Gentoo's [Portage][3] to build stuff yourself.

Anyway, for the last few months, all was going mostly well... but I miss Windows. And, given i have pretty much always ran a server OS on my main workstations, I am heading back to Server 2012R2. I was tempted by 2016, but its still very early days... Maybe i will run it as a VM for a while, but we will see...
