 Well, its finally happened. All my blogs, [Tiernan's Comms Closet][1], [GeekPhotographer][2] and the [Podcast][3] have been
moved to [Jekyll][4]. I wrote up [a long and complicated][5] post explaining how I did it... Now, i dont have to worry
about [Wordpress][6] security issues on my home sites! Happy Days!
