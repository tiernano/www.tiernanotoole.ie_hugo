Microsoft [Build 2016][1] is on this week, and there were a lot of interesting developments yesterday, but the one that interested me the most is [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows][2]. [Dustin from Ubuntu][3] has a more details, and Scott Hanselman has posted [a technical video][4] about this. This is very interesting, and I CANT WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT! But, I do have some questions, which I thought I would put down in blog format:

- Based on the post by Dustin, it seems that low level Linux calls are being handled and translated to Windows system calls. Which makes me think, could **any** Linux Distro work? Could [Arch Linux][5], [RedHat][6] or [Centos][7] work in the same way? 
- Will this Work on Windows Server 2016 when it launches?
- Given that it calling down to a low level, could GUI applications work too?
- Shut up and take my money! I WANT IT NOW!

So, there are my questions... This is very cool, and I cannot wait to get my hands on this. Just wondering if this will be available to [Windows Insiders][8] sooner, rather than later?
